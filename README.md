# Inferno
A creative writing project that I am writing the website for. It's absurdly long isekai title name is "The delinquent who decided to reform himself in another world with flaming passion... literally"

I'm working (hopefully) on this project where I am going to write a isekai story (as you can guess, it's going to be in a webnovel format I suppose).
This Isekai story will be one that I can personally be proud of, that hopefully won't be regarded as "trash isekai". This story aims to have real 
character development and personal conflict. I aim to also have actual plot conflict, but I also aim to have a powerful character (maybe OP in other stories,
but this story takes inspiration from Ragna Crimson and Dragon Ball Z in having the enemies kind of be incredibly strong too). 

In general this story is going to be a mix of Ragna Crimson, Wind Breaker, and your average fantasy Isekai. No gamey elements though. Or should I have gamey elements?
